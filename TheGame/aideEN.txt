<big><u><b>I - Aim of the game</b></u></big>

The player's goal is to move as much as possible in the game environment. For this, he can fight monsters and recover their items, as weapons and armor, and he can equip it directly or sell/buy better gear from vendors. The game ends when the player dies, state reached when he has no more energy. The player's score is then calculated according to different characteristics (number of enemies killed,  gold won, level, ...), the goal is to get the highest score possible.

<big><u><b>II - Turns</b></u></big>

A turn is the implementation of an action.
By game actions are included:
- Moving (1 turn)
- Resting (10 turns)
- Actions preceded by pressing the interaction button (interaction with a healer, a merchant, an object) (1 turn).

<big><u><b>III - Energy</b></u></big>

The player has an energy bar allowing him to make moves and combat. He dies when he has no more energy.

<big><u><b>IV - Experience</b></u></big>

During combat, your energy is consumed according to the energy of the enemy.

<big><u><b>VII - Rest</b></u></big>

Rest allows the player to restore his energy. A rest consumption immobilises him during 10 turns, one turn allows to win 10% of energy.
